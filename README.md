### Project Title
GitHub repository for bikeshare project

### Description
Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day. Thanks to the rise in information technologies, it is easy for a user of the system to access a dock within the system to unlock or return bicycles. These technologies also provide a wealth of data that can be used to explore how these bike-sharing systems are used. We will learn about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics.

### Files used
chicago.csv, new_york_city.csv, washington.csv

### Credits
In this project, we will use data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns.
